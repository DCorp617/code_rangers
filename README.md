* Ruby version: 2.4.5-p355

* Rails version: 5.2.3

* Technologies used: Park Lark™ is a React based web application that uses Rails to redirect the initial traffic to our React components. We use a Wikipedia API to extract vital information that renders only when a user is in a particular page. This allows for 90% faster loading speeds compared to when all of our information would pre-load before the user got a chance to interact with our site.
